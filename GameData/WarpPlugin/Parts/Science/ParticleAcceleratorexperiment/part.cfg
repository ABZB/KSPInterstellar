description = This experiment was designed after a class action lawsuit from all of kerbal kind against Netherdyne for nearly destroying Kerbin.  We say nearly because it was only theoretical.  Turns out most of kerbin's population doesn't know what that word means, not that Netherdyne had any trouble paying the settlement.  We recommend building this on orbit.
