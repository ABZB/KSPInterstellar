	RESULTS
	{
		default = Recorded accurate measurements of the magnetosphere.

		KerbinInSpaceLow = The magnetic field is strong here, it appears to be shielding the area from cosmic rays.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The magnetic field is much weaker at this altitude and there are far more cosmic rays.  Is this safe?
		
		MunInSpaceLow = The magnetic field appears too weak to indicate the presence of a Keodynamo with the core of the Mun.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Multiple checks reveal that this instrument is, in fact, switched on.

		MinmusInSpaceLow = There must be some iron under all that green.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Staring at the detector result for hours yields a recording of the faintest magnetic fluctuation.

		GillyInSpace = It certainly didn't capture a magnetic field.

		MohoInSpaceLow = This magnetic field seems leaky but surprisingly strong for Moho's size and rotation rate.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = The solar wind seems to be being deflected.

		EveInSpaceLow = This location seems safe enough from Cosmic Rays.
		EveInSpaceHigh = Are those cosmic rays purple?

		DunaInSpace = This magnetic field is not very strong, the atmosphere doesn't look like it offers much protection either.

		IkeInSpace = Another tidally locked moon with a predictably weak magnetic field.
		
		DresInSpace = Perhaps its core isn't warm enough to support a powerful magnetic field.
		
		JoolInSpaceLow = Yikes!  Is this reading supposed to go up to 11?
		JoolInSpaceLow = There are an awful lot of particles trapped here.  I wonder if they're useful...
		JoolInSpaceLow = A lot of charged particles seem to be passing through the ship, is that normal?
		JoolInSpaceHigh = The readings aren't usually so high so early.  This could be a big one.

		LaytheInSpaceLow = Some kind of resonance seems to be generating heating of the core and strengthening the magnetic field.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = There is a strong magnetic field here... Jool's.

		VallInSpace = Valls magnetic field seems to be mostly being induced by Jool.  Perhaps there is something conductive down there somewhere.
		
		TyloInSpaceLow = Seems to be generating a strong enough magnetic field to create a tiny embedded magnetosphere inside Jool's.
		TyloInSpaceHigh = Detecting a small disruption of the Joolian magnetosphere.

		BopInSpace = Are Krakens magnetic?
		
		PolInSpace = A powerful magnetic field seems to be coming from that small green sphere over there!

		EelooInSpace = Eeloo does not appear to be ideally composed for the generation of powerful magnetic fields.

		SunInSpaceLow = The readings are off the scale.  Perhaps the heat is causing a malfunction.
		SunInSpaceHigh = The sun's magnetic field appears to utterly dominate the behaviour of charged particles in the solar system.
